        <h2 class="title">Mercury</h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          Mercury, the smallest and innermost planet, orbits the Sun in just 88 Earth days. 
          It has a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles) and is roughly 38% the 
          size of Earth. Due to its proximity to the Sun, temperatures on Mercury can reach 
          a searing 430°C (800°F) during the day, but because it has almost no atmosphere to 
          retain heat, nighttime temperatures drop dramatically to -180°C (-290°F). The 
          planet’s surface is heavily cratered, resembling our Moon. Mercury has no moons 
          and no rings. Its thin atmosphere, called an exosphere, is composed mainly of 
          oxygen, sodium, and hydrogen.

        <h2 class="title">Venus</h2>
        <p class="text-right">
          Venus, often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and 
          composition, is the second planet from the Sun. It has a thick, toxic 
          atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. 
          This dense atmosphere traps heat, creating an intense greenhouse effect 
          that makes Venus the hottest planet in the Solar System, with surface temperatures 
          around 465°C (869°F), even hotter than Mercury. Venus rotates very slowly 
          and in the opposite direction to most planets, meaning it has a day (243 Earth days) 
          that’s longer than its year (225 Earth days). Its surface is dotted with 
          volcanoes and vast plains. Despite its harsh conditions, Venus has intrigued 
          scientists for potential studies of atmospheric and surface processes.

        <h2 class="title">Earth</h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to 
          harbor life. It has a unique atmosphere, composed mostly of nitrogen 
          and oxygen, which supports diverse ecosystems and protects the planet 
          from harmful solar radiation. Earth has a moderate climate, liquid water 
          on its surface, and a magnetic field that shields it from cosmic and 
          solar radiation. The planet’s surface is 71% water, with the remaining 
          29% being continents and islands. Earth’s atmosphere and distance from 
          the Sun make it perfect for sustaining life. It has one natural satellite, 
          the Moon, which influences tides and helps stabilize the planet's axial tilt.

        <h2 class="title">Mars</h2>
        <p class="text-right">
          Mars, known as the "Red Planet," is the fourth planet from the Sun. Its reddish 
          appearance is due to iron oxide (rust) on its surface. Mars has a thin atmosphere, 
          primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with very low air pressure, making it impossible 
          for liquid water to exist for long on the surface. However, evidence suggests that 
          liquid water once flowed on Mars, and there may be water ice beneath its surface. The 
          planet has seasons, polar ice caps, and the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus 
          Mons, which stands nearly three times the height of Mount Everest. Mars has two small moons, 
          Phobos and Deimos. Scientists are particularly interested in Mars because it shows potential 
          signs of past life and could be a future destination for human exploration.

        <h2 class="title">Jupiter</h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, is the largest planet in the Solar System, more than 
          twice as massive as all the other planets combined. It’s a gas giant, composed mostly of 
          hydrogen and helium, and lacks a solid surface. Its atmosphere is famous for its colorful 
          bands and the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has raged for over 300 years. Jupiter has 
          at least 79 moons, the largest of which—Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa—are known as the 
          Galilean moons. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System. Jupiter's strong magnetic 
          field and numerous moons make it an object of intense scientific study.

        <h2 class="title">Saturn</h2>
        <p class="text-right">
          Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is renowned for its stunning ring system, which is made up of 
          ice, dust, and rock particles. It’s a gas giant like Jupiter, composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. 
          Saturn is the second-largest planet in the Solar System, with a diameter about nine times that of Earth. 
          It has at least 83 moons, with Titan being the largest and even bigger than Mercury. Titan is particularly 
          interesting because it has a thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane and ethane, making it a potential 
          site for studying prebiotic chemistry. Saturn's rings and its complex moon system make it one of the most 
          visually spectacular objects in the Solar System.

        <h2 class="title">Uranus</h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is an ice giant, composed mainly of water, 
          ammonia, and methane ices, atop a small rocky core. Unlike other planets, Uranus rotates 
          on its side, meaning it has extreme seasonal variations. Its pale blue color is due to 
          the methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue. Uranus has 27 
          known moons and a faint ring system. Its magnetic field is also unusual, as it is tilted 
          at an angle different from its rotational axis. Uranus is one of the least explored 
          planets, with only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, having flown by it in 1986.

        <p class="text-right">
          Neptune, the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun, is also an ice giant. 
          It is similar to Uranus in composition but has a deeper blue color due to its atmospheric 
          composition. Neptune has the strongest winds in the Solar System, with speeds reaching up 
          to 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph). It takes about 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around 
          the Sun. Neptune has at least 14 moons, the largest being Triton, which is geologically 
          active, with geysers that eject nitrogen gas into space. Like Uranus, Neptune also has 
          a faint ring system. Despite its distance from the Sun, Neptune is still an active and 
          dynamic planet.
